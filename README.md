<b>Git/Github</b>
<br>
If you haven't used git before I would give it a go! It is a powerful tool that allows you to version control the code you write.
<br>
To learn the basics of git and github there are some links below:

  <li><a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/" target="_blank">GitHub Tutorial</a></li>
</ul>  
  
Feel free to change the code any way you like, it's all yours!

<b>Good Study Habits</b>
<br>
As I've said in Pass Sessions I've learnt good habits through:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Trial and error.</li>
  <li>Asking others how they study.</li>
  <li>Personal research.</li>
</ul>
