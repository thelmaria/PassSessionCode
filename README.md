# Pass Session Code Examples
Pass Session Code.

<i>Please note: The examples are not perfect implementations. They are examples made by students during the PASS classes
to help explain concepts. If you find any errors feel free to add an issue or pull request (if you know how to use GitHub). If not post on the University fourms and I'll fix it.</i>

All the code examples from <b>Programming Fundamentals</b> can be found in the Java folder above. 

Hit the big green <img src="https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/clone-repo-clone-url-button.png" alt=""> button to download all the code.

<b>Git/Github</b>
<br>
If you haven't used git before I would give it a go! It is a powerful tool that allows you to version control the code you write.
<br>
To learn the basics of git and github there are some links below:
<br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1" target="_blank">Git Tutorial</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/" target="_blank">GitHub Tutorial</a></li>
</ul>  
  
Feel free to change the code any way you like, it's all yours!

<b>Algorithm Practice</b>
<br>
Tough algorithm questions are usually part of the exam and if they aren't they are always good for practice either way. The below links provide you to tons of questions that will stretch you and make you think more deeply. Give it a go, I promise it will be worth your time!
* [Codingbat](http://codingbat.com/java) - Practice logic, string and algorithm questions in java, in the browser! 
* [ProjectEuler](https://projecteuler.net/) - Progressively hard programming questions (based on math problems) - It's tought but I promise you your problem solving skills will dramatically increase if you have a go!
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) - Compete against other programmers in any type of problems you like, a majority of problems can be done in Java!

<b>Good Study Habits</b>
<br>
As I've said in Pass Sessions I've learnt good habits through:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Trial and error.</li>
  <li>Asking others how they study.</li>
  <li>Personal research.</li>
</ul>

Here is a list of books that have helped me with my study habits:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Life-Half-Second-Achieve-Success-ebook/dp/B00FZFB2OI" target="_blank">Life in Half a Second</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Success-Carol-Dweck/dp/0345472322" target="_blank">Mindset: The New Psychology of Success </a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra/dp/039916524X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1471948200&sr=8-1&keywords=a+mind+for+numbers" target="_blank">A Mind for Numbers</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Become-Straight-Student-Unconventional/dp/0767922719" target="_blank">How to Become a Straight-A Student</a></li>

</ul>
